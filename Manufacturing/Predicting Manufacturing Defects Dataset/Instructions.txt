About Dataset
Introduction
This dataset provides insights into factors influencing defect rates in a manufacturing environment. Each record represents various metrics crucial for predicting high or low defect occurrences in production processes.

Variables Description
Production Metrics
ProductionVolume: Number of units produced per day.

Data Type: Integer.
Range: 100 to 1000 units/day.
ProductionCost: Cost incurred for production per day.
Data Type: Float.
Range: $5000 to $20000.
Supply Chain and Logistics
SupplierQuality: Quality ratings of suppliers.

Data Type: Float (%).
Range: 80% to 100%.
DeliveryDelay: Average delay in delivery.
Data Type: Integer (days).
Range: 0 to 5 days.
Quality Control and Defect Rates
DefectRate: Defects per thousand units produced.

Data Type: Float.
Range: 0.5 to 5.0 defects.
QualityScore: Overall quality assessment.
Data Type: Float (%).
Range: 60% to 100%.
Maintenance and Downtime
MaintenanceHours: Hours spent on maintenance per week.

Data Type: Integer.
Range: 0 to 24 hours.
DowntimePercentage: Percentage of production downtime.
Data Type: Float (%).
Range: 0% to 5%.
Inventory Management
InventoryTurnover: Ratio of inventory turnover.

Data Type: Float.
Range: 2 to 10.
StockoutRate: Rate of inventory stockouts.
Data Type: Float (%).
Range: 0% to 10%.
Workforce Productivity and Safety
WorkerProductivity: Productivity level of the workforce.

Data Type: Float (%).
Range: 80% to 100%.
SafetyIncidents: Number of safety incidents per month.
Data Type: Integer.
Range: 0 to 10 incidents.
Energy Consumption and Efficiency
EnergyConsumption: Energy consumed in kWh.

Data Type: Float.
Range: 1000 to 5000 kWh.
EnergyEfficiency: Efficiency factor of energy usage.
Data Type: Float.
Range: 0.1 to 0.5.
Additive Manufacturing
AdditiveProcessTime: Time taken for additive manufacturing.

Data Type: Float (hours).
Range: 1 to 10 hours.
AdditiveMaterialCost: Cost of additive materials per unit.
Data Type: Float ($).
Range: $100 to $500.
Target Variable
DefectStatus: Predicted defect status.

Data Type: Binary (0 for Low Defects, 1 for High Defects).
Defect Instances
The dataset focuses on defect instances more because they do not occur often. However, non-defect instances were added too for this reason the dataset is imbalanced, consider balancing it before proceeding with machine learning techniques.

Data Conclusion
This dataset encompasses a comprehensive collection of metrics vital for predicting defect rates in manufacturing operations. It includes production volumes, supply chain quality, quality control assessments, maintenance schedules, inventory management details, workforce productivity metrics, energy consumption patterns, additive manufacturing specifics, and more.
