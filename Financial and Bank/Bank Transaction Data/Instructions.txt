About Dataset
Context
Our main motive was to build analytical tool:

Which would categorise the similar transactions on the basis of narrations

Which can extract the bank names or the short form of the bank names using the IFSC codes

Which can knock off the same amount transactions with Debit and Credit effect on same date in two different accounts and matching narrations.

Check out my work here. Our another objective was to build a tool to categorize the narrations appearing in the bank statements into a logical manner. These are consolidated and extracted bank account statements of various bank accounts.

Account No. - This represents the account number involved in transaction.

Date - Date of transaction

Transaction Details - Transaction narrations in bank statements

Cheque No. - This indicates the cheque number

Value Date - Date of completion of transaction

Withdrawal Amount - Indicates the amount withdrawn

Deposit Amount - Indicates the amount deposited

Balance Amount - Current balance of account

Inspiration
We want to detect fraud transactions and money laundering. It is the concealment of the origins of illegally obtained money, typically by means of transfers involving foreign banks or legitimate businesses.
